## Task
 In the class `de.uni_passau.fim.se2.developer_productivity.Evaluation` there are 20 code snippets where in everyone 
 there is one methode name represented as an arbitrary number of `_`. These underscores do not indicate the length 
 of the original method name, they are just different numbers of `_` to avoid naming conflicts.  
 Your task is now to replace these method names with appropriate ones according to your opinion. 
 To support you the previous installed plugin will provide you some suggestion for every method name.
 To request such suggestion just place your cursor within a method name and press `macos: ctrl + enter` or `windows: 
 alt + enter`. In the opened dialogue select `Suggest method name`. This will provide you with 10 suggestions for 
 this method name. Whether you think one is appropriate you can select this one or name the method on your own. So 
 please do not name the method randomly to finish task.
