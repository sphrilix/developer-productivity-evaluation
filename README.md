# User Study Code2Vec IntelliJ Plugin

## Initialization

Run:
```
git clone https://github.com/sphrilix/developer-productivity-evaluation.git
```
After that open the cloned repo in IntelliJ. Open the `Preferences/Plugins` in it. Click on the gear and 
select the `.zip` located in `./plugin`. Now the plugin is installed.  

Checkout out the branch which is on the paper that you received at the beginning and start with the task.


## Task
Rename methods which are represented by an arbitrary number of `_` in `de.uni_passau.fim.se2.
developer_productivity.Evaluation`(The amount of underscores is just arbitrary to avoid naming conflicts and does
not indicate any length of an appropriate name). Please name the methods
appropriate  according to your opinion,  and do not just give them random names in order to finish the task.    
To support you, the plugin is capable of providing suggestion for every method name.
To request such suggestion, just place your cursor within a method name and press `macos: ctrl + enter` or `windows:
alt + enter`. In the opened dialogue, select `Suggest method name`. This will provide you with 10 suggestions for
this method name. If you think one of the suggestions will fit, select this one or name the method on your own.
If you renamed all 20 methods, open the `Preferences/Tools/Deepcode` and click on finish. After that push your
changes and fill out the following survey
